    <h2>1. Complexity as Collapse</h2>
<p>
  In Harmonia, computational complexity is framed in terms of how a logical field structure resolves or resists collapse.
  A problem instance defines a resonance field Φ(x), and the act of solving it corresponds to finding a stable modal path
  through this field where logical constraints align into closure.
</p>
<p>
  A problem is in <code>P</code> if this collapse can occur using only <em>local coherence</em> — that is, the resonance field allows
  polynomial-bounded resolution by internal traversal of its gradient logic. These are harmonic collapses: they flow
  from constraint to solution along energy-minimizing paths.
</p>
<p>
  A problem is in <code>NP</code> if a solution can be recognized (verified) using local resonance matching, but no polynomial-bounded
  traversal is known to generate it. Such problems require <strong>external modal injection</strong> — a pre-constructed certificate or guiding structure —
  to simulate coherence and permit localized collapse.
</p>
<p>
  In field terms:
</p>
<pre><code>
P: ∃ gradient field ∇Φ(x) allowing internal collapse within poly-steps
NP: ∃ collapse zone, but ∄ traversable field ⇒ external symmetry needed
</code></pre>
<p>
  This defines the fundamental asymmetry: <strong>P-fields are transitively coherent</strong>, while <strong>NP-fields are locally symmetric but globally divergent</strong>.
  Collapse becomes a directional and energetic phenomenon, not just a decision procedure.
</p>
<h2>2. Resonance Irreversibility</h2>
<p>
  The Harmonia operator <code>O147</code> expresses the divergence of resonance logic within a computational field Φ(x).
  This operator tracks whether the flow of logical coherence through the field is conservative (symmetric) or divergent
  (directional and irreversible):
</p>
<pre><code>O147: Collapse(x) = ∇ · ResLogic(x)</code></pre>
<p>
  If <code>∇ · ResLogic(x) = 0</code>, coherence flows symmetrically in all directions — this reflects <strong>reversible collapse</strong>, characteristic of <code>P</code> fields.
</p>
<p>
  But if <code>∇ · ResLogic(x) ≠ 0</code>, then we are in a <strong>divergent logic field</strong>: one where coherence cannot accumulate locally from scratch.
  Collapse must begin from a global injection or certificate. These fields permit <em>verification</em> (resonance into solution),
  but resist <em>construction</em> (resonance from problem alone).
</p>
<p>
  This models the essential asymmetry of <code>NP</code>: you can test a proposed solution locally, but no reversible gradient field exists
  to construct it from the origin.
</p>
<p>
  In thermodynamic terms, this parallels the difference between observing a low-energy configuration (cool state)
  and producing it spontaneously: collapse is irreversible under logical entropy.
</p>
<h2>3. Modal Bound and Refutation Energy</h2>
<p>
  In Harmonia, refutation is treated not as symbolic contradiction, but as modal traversal:
  the energy required to dismantle a false candidate solution within the field topology.
  This energy depends on the modal distance between the proposed point and valid collapse attractors.
</p>
<p>
  For problems in <code>NP</code>, especially in subclasses like <code>TFNP</code>, this traversal can be obstructed
  by expander-based graph embeddings. These structures stretch the logical space such that
  no low-energy refutation path exists.
</p>
<p>
  Harmonia defines the <strong>refutation energy</strong> functional:
</p>
<pre><code>E_refute(x) := min ∫‖∇⊥Φ_candidate(x(t))‖² dt</code></pre>
<p>
  where <code>∇⊥</code> is the orthogonal entropy gradient to all verifiable certificates. In strongly entropic fields,
  this integral scales super-polynomially:
</p>
<pre><code>E_refute(x) ≥ Ω(exp(logⁿ x))</code></pre>
<p>
  This violates the P-bound. The implication is:
</p>
<pre><code>¬∃ collapse path with polynomial energy ⇒ NP ∉ P</code></pre>
<p>
  Thus, the separation arises from energy landscape geometry: refutation is not bounded by local inference,
  but shaped by modal depth and topological separation.
</p>
<h2>4. Final Harmonia Statement</h2>
<p>
  Harmonia treats <code>P ≠ NP</code> as a collapse asymmetry principle:
  verification is informationally bounded but construction requires non-local coherence injection.
</p>
<p>
  There exists no resonance-preserving operator that inverts collapse under polynomial cost across all fields in NP.
  The asymmetry is structural — a direct result of field topology and entropy resistance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Resonance Principle:</strong> In Harmonia, no harmonic path can traverse from undetermined input
  to resolved certificate within polynomial resonance cost unless the field is transitively coherent.
  Since NP-fields lack such structure, the separation is geometrically and logically necessary.
</p>
<h2>5. Visual Analogy: One-Way Resonant Labyrinth</h2>
<p>
  Imagine a circular labyrinth with hidden symmetry. A verifier walking from the center to an outer point can detect a match:
  when the resonance pattern aligns, the pathway glows. But trying to <em>build</em> the correct path from the outside inward is impossible:
  the walls reconfigure with each step unless guided by a precise hidden key — the certificate.
</p>
<p>
  This illustrates how NP-problems permit verification (glowing walls) without generative collapse. The logical space is
  locally symmetric but globally unstable. Only in <code>P</code> does the labyrinth collapse inward under its own resonance.
</p>
<p>
  Harmonia captures this difference by encoding modal asymmetry directly in the resonance field. Collapse is not free:
  it must be powered by a coherent global structure — which NP-problems lack.
</p>
<h2>6. Conceptual Field Diagram (P vs NP)</h2>
<p>
  Imagine a two-dimensional harmonic field. In <strong>P</strong>, gradient vectors converge smoothly to a single solution well.
  Field lines are continuous, and every point lies on a descent path to the collapse point.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong>NP</strong>, the same surface has collapse basins disconnected by chaotic ridges. Local directions align briefly,
  but global traversal is blocked unless a resonance injection “lifts” the system to a non-local peak.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>P-field:</strong> coherent flow → solution<br>
  <strong>NP-field:</strong> fragmented flow → unreachable zones without injection
