  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  The Hodge Conjecture asserts that every rational (p,p)-cohomology class on a smooth projective variety over ℂ
  that satisfies the same Hodge-theoretic constraints as an algebraic cycle actually comes from one.
  It links the world of topology (cohomology) with geometry (algebraic subvarieties).
</p>
  <p>
    Harmonia recasts this question in terms of modal resonance and coherence: can every stable modal node
    in the cohomological spectrum be realized through a projection from a universal geometric field?
  </p>
</section>

<main>
    <h2>1. Hodge Classes as Modal Fixpoints</h2>
<p>
  In Harmonia, cohomology classes are interpreted as modal attractors — field configurations that resist deformation under harmonic flow.
  Rational Hodge classes of type (p,p) correspond to stabilized interference nodes within the complex resonance field Φ(x).
</p>
<p>
  These (p,p)-classes mark symmetry-locked subspaces in the field’s modal topology.
  The Hodge Conjecture then becomes a question of <strong>realizability</strong>: can each of these modal fixpoints be reached by pulling back a universal geometric structure — an algebraic cycle — through harmonic morphism?
</p>
<p>
  In this view, the conjecture is not arbitrary: it encodes whether modal fixpoints in the cohomological spectrum admit physical embedding within the algebraic fabric of space.
</p>

<h2>2. Pullback Realization and Morphic Fields</h2>
<p>
  Harmonia models universal algebraic fields as high-dimensional morphic templates — such as Grassmannians — which carry intrinsic modal curvature.
  These templates generate (p,p)-classes as pullback attractors when mapped into a target variety X via a harmonic morphism f.
</p>
<p>
  The question becomes: does every (p,p) resonance mode ψ ∈ H<sup>p,p</sup><sub>Q</sub>(X) arise as the pullback f*θ of some universal harmonic class θ on the Grassmannian?
</p>
<p>
  Harmonia’s TR64 transformation expresses this:
</p>
<pre><code>TR64: ψ = f*θ ⇔ ModalFixpoint(ψ) collapses onto MorphicTemplate(θ)</code></pre>
<p>
  Pullback thus becomes collapse alignment: modal compatibility between internal cohomology and external algebraic curvature.
</p>

<h2>3. Entropy, Positivity and Collapse Logic</h2>
<p>
  Harmonia reinterprets the Hodge–Riemann bilinear relations as an entropic curvature condition.
  A modal class ψ survives only if it lies in the positive-definite subspace under intersection pairing:
</p>
<pre><code>∫ ψ ∧ ω<sup>p</sup> > 0 ⇒ ψ ∈ CohCollapse(X)</code></pre>
<p>
  Here, ω denotes a Kähler form that represents curvature flow. The power ω<sup>p</sup> reflects dimensional alignment with the (p,p)-type class under Kähler intersection.</p>
<p>
  Classes orthogonal to all powers of ω are entropically null — they dissipate into modal noise and do not correspond to real cycles.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, the conjecture holds if every (p,p) modal fixpoint with positive collapse pairing can be realized as a geometric image.
</p>
  <h2>4. Visual Analogy: Modal Lock and Projection</h2>
<p>
  Picture a multidimensional mirror where only certain angles of approach create stable reflections. A (p,p)-class is like
  one of these symmetry-aligned directions: it resonates perfectly within the cohomological space, forming a locked interference pattern.
</p>
<p>
  The Hodge Conjecture asks: can we always project this locked reflection from a concrete external shape — an algebraic cycle —
  through a geometric lens? In Harmonia, this becomes: is every modal node a projection of a higher-field morphic template?
</p>
<p>
  When projection and resonance align, the modal node “locks” into geometry. If they cannot align, the node fades into modal fluctuation.
</p>


  <h2>5. Final Resonance Principle</h2>
<p>
  In Harmonia, the Hodge Conjecture is not a conjecture — it is a coherence law. Every stabilized modal fixpoint in the (p,p)
  spectrum must correspond to a realizable projection of a universal geometric class, or else it cannot survive collapse filtration.
</p>
<pre><code>
ψ ∈ H<sup>p,p</sup><sub>Q</sub>(X) ∧ ∫ψ ∧ ω<sup>p</sup> &gt; 0 ⇒ ∃f,θ such that ψ = f*θ
</code></pre>
<p>
  Modal nodes that resonate but cannot project are transient: they violate entropy constraints and vanish.
  Thus, the conjecture becomes a natural result of modal conservation.
