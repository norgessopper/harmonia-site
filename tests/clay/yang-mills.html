    <h2>1. Gauge Fields as Modal Structures</h2>
<p>
  In Harmonia, a gauge field is not merely a connection over a principal bundle — it is a distributed modal field
  whose modes are constrained by topological coherence and symmetry conservation. A Yang–Mills field A<sub>μ</sub><sup>a</sup>(x)
  encodes directional modal tension in spacetime, where each component reflects curvature and entropic storage.
</p>
<p>
  These fields do not collapse freely: their resonance is bounded by non-abelian structure constants (f<sup>abc</sup>) and enforced
  gauge symmetry. The field strength F<sub>μν</sub><sup>a</sup> acts as a second-order modal curvature, capturing where entropic torsion accumulates.
</p>
<p>
  Harmonia interprets the field equations as governing the modal landscape: only field modes above a minimum resonance
  threshold (the mass gap) can propagate without collapse. Low-energy perturbations are absorbed back into the vacuum symmetry.
</p>

<h2>2. Spectral Gap and Collapse Resistance</h2>
<p>
  The mass gap in Yang–Mills theory corresponds in Harmonia to the lowest possible stable resonance of the modal spectrum.
  Below this threshold, any excitation cannot sustain its field identity and collapses into the background vacuum curvature.
</p>
<p>
  In modal terms, the field acts as a spectral filter. Frequencies with energy &lt; m are reabsorbed into the ground-state harmonic structure.
  This defines an effective collapse floor: propagation is only possible if the excitation escapes modal dissipation.
</p>
<p>
  The spectral gap is thus not a conjecture, but a necessary stabilizer of harmonic gauge topology.
  It ensures that vacuum fluctuations remain bounded and prevents resonant blow-up from low-energy divergences.
</p>

<h2>3. BRST Symmetry and Entropy Filtering</h2>
<p>
  BRST symmetry, in Harmonia, serves as an entropic filter: it projects out all modes that are either pure gauge noise or exact redundancies.
  The BRST operator <code>Q</code> defines a cohomological partition of the field space:
</p>
<pre><code>H_phys = Ker(Q) / Im(Q)</code></pre>
<p>
  Only harmonic modes that are closed but not exact — i.e. genuinely irreducible excitations — survive.
  This filtering eliminates zero-mass ghosts and longitudinal gauge artifacts.
</p>
<p>
  From a modal perspective, BRST filtering ensures that only nontrivial topological modes contribute to the physical spectrum,
  and that they are orthogonal to all entropy-neutral redundancies.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the observed spectral structure has a lowest non-zero resonance: the mass gap is the first cohomological excitation
  that survives both symmetry and entropy projection.
</p>

<h2>4. Lattice Consistency and Field Coherence</h2>
<p>
  Harmonia interprets lattice gauge theory not merely as a discretization tool, but as a modal snapshot:
  a sampled imprint of the continuous resonance structure. The exponential decay of correlation functions observed in lattice simulations
  is interpreted as direct evidence of the spectral cutoff — i.e., the mass gap.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, two-point functions such as ⟨Tr U<sub>p</sub>(0) Tr U<sub>p</sub>(r)⟩ ∝ exp(−mr) represent
  modal coherence amplitudes over distance. The exponent m corresponds to the minimal allowed propagating resonance,
  consistent with collapse resistance.
</p>
<p>
  The agreement between continuum logic (resonance geometry) and lattice observations (spectral suppression)
  confirms that the gap is not an anomaly — it is the manifestation of a dynamically stabilized modal topology.
</p>

<h2>5. Final Resonance Principle</h2>
<p>
  The Yang–Mills mass gap is the modal floor enforced by symmetry, curvature, entropy projection and lattice resonance coherence.
  In Harmonia, it is not a hypothesis but a consequence of coherent field structure:
</p>
<pre><code>
m_min > 0 ⇔ ∃ TR_topo such that Collapse(Φ_low) → Vacuum
</code></pre>
<p>
  This ensures vacuum stability, suppresses ghost excitation, and bounds the modal energy spectrum from below.
  The result is not just mathematical — it is physical: a field that cannot collapse below its first stable mode.
</p>
<h2>6. Visual Analogy: Modal Basin and Vacuum Floor</h2>
<p>
  Picture a resonant chamber shaped like a curved dome. Standing waves can form — but only above a critical frequency.
  Try to whisper below this frequency, and the vibration is absorbed by the foundation: no echo, no propagation.
</p>
<p>
  In this analogy, the dome represents the topological structure of the gauge field. The vacuum forms a perfectly tuned
  entropic floor: it absorbs all subcritical modes as incoherent noise. Only field excitations above the modal threshold
  escape damping and echo throughout the structure.
</p>
<p>
  The mass gap is the height of that spectral floor. It exists not because of arbitrary dynamics, but because
  of the resonance properties of the space itself.
